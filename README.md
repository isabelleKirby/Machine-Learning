# Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration

This is the [code](https://github.com/isabelleKirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Assignment%201.cpp) and the [paper](https://github.com/isabelleKirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Assignment%201%20Paper.docx) for my data exploration.

#Portfolio Component 2: Linear Models

This is the pdf created for [Regression](https://github.com/isabelleKirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Models/Regression.pdf) and [Classification](https://github.com/isabelleKirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Models/Classification.pdf). In this homework we used Linear and Logistic Regression to process datasets found online.
